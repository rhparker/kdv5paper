\opening{Dear Editor,}

On behalf of my co-author, Bj\"orn Sandstede, I would like to submit the article ``Periodic multi-pulses and spectral stability in Hamiltonian PDEs with symmetry'' for consideration of publication in the Journal of Differential Equations. In this paper, we investigate the existence and spectral stability of multi-pulse solutions to Hamiltonian PDEs on a periodic domain. In particular, we look at Hamiltonian PDEs which are reversible and translation invariant, for which the fifth-order Korteweg-de Vries equation is a prototypical example. Most notably, we prove that for 2-pulses on a perioidic domain, brief instability bubbles form when eigenvalues collide on the imaginary axis as the size of the periodic domain is altered. We present numerical computations which are in agreement with our analytical results.

This paper has not been submitted elsewhere.

\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
